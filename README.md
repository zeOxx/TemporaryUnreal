# TemporaryUnreal
A temporary repository for my current Unreal Engine 4 projects, containing only .cpp and .h files. Both of these projects also take advantage of blueprints, which is not represented here at all.
Both of these projects are in their infancies and should not be considered anywhere near final. Both of these are however playable

## UnrealSouls
A project trying to mimic the 'Souls' series of games (Demon's Souls, Dark Souls I & II)

## Daisy
A survival multiplayer game, ala DayZ
